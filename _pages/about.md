I am a first year computer science PhD student at the National University of Singapore under the Salesforce-EDB Industrial Postgraduate Programme, supervised by A/P Kan Min-Yen and Dr Shafiq Joty. My research interests include machine reading comprehension and dialogue systems, but I've also been fascinated by the puzzle of cognition for the longest time. Before embarking on my PhD journey, I graduated from the CS programme and University Scholars Programme at NUS and interned for half a year as a product manager for a conversational AI platform in the SF Bay Area.

Outside of work, I read widely (my brain loves it, my eyes hate it), especially in philosophy, psychology, and physics. I've also been practising Chinese martial arts for a while now and have been trying (but failing) to pick up a musical instrument.
